speak and when he finally could after he collected himself after he choked back the emotion he said this of the gut wrenching devastation that lie only few feet in front of him smoldering in the early morning sunlight am in shock am so disheartened he said am just so sorry for the city just pause in front of us fire trucks with ladders blasted water at the smoldering ruins of lake building the ambassador hotel which opened in as the majestic hotel once billed as the most elegantly appointed hotel in the south at times tuesday the hotel seemed to disappear behind shroud of smoke felt like was entrusted to restore it lake began again we were getting there in fits and starts and then then this happens amanda moreno lake wife stood next to him wiping away tears as though loved one had just died moreno and lake could have turned the ambassador into hotel long ago some lodging chains wanted in but lake and moreno waved off all comers insisting they would do the work themselves because we rather have something dallas residents could be part of and call home lake told me in february lake responsible for the rebirths of the bishop arts district jefferson tower and mayor george sergeant year old home on north zang boulevard had given me tour of the ambassador only three months ago it was my first and now only time inside the long vacant building that historic designation documents refer to as the oldest luxury hotel in dallas its strange history included visits from theodore roosevelt sarah bernhardt woodrow wilson joey ramone william howard taft and morrissey lake had bought the hotel in he began the restoration work two years later converting the hotel into month micro apartments with pool and restaurant and basement speakeasy and ground floor retail when visited crews had begun to strip the insides of its toxic leftovers yet even in decay and disrepair it felt singular faded yesterday worthy of countless more tomorrows but aside from some remediation the redo had not yet begun in earnest because lake needed the city council to approve closing off st paul street at east griffin street to make way for the ambassador new driveway the dallas city council approved that closure last wednesday council members did not discuss or debate the agenda item it took only seconds of their time the years it took to get to that minute at city hall were now all for nothing dallas fire rescue on tuesday began their own plans to put out any remaining hot spots then prepare for crews to level what remains of the ambassador laying the building down fire engineer called it tuesday morning as he shuffled the names of firefighters coming on duty to spell colleagues who began wrestling the inferno shortly after there will be no salvage said the firefighter of the history that died tuesday morning investigators will get in there too to determine whether the cause was manslaughter or suicide hard as it is to believe this devastation could have been worse standing off to the side in the shadow of the year old hughes brothers candy factory building on ervay jerry nappi iii the building caretaker told his co workers how he narrowly escaped dying in the fire his trailer was parked on the st paul side and at tuesday as he lay sleeping nappi said homeless man began yelling for him to wake up get out he rubbed the sleep from his eyes and went outside he could see nothing there was too much smoke nappi had only time enough to collect his dog get into his truck and drive could hear windows shattering coming down he said within minutes side of the wall came down smashing his trailer his home lost everything own nappi said except what am wearing black ball cap black shirt blue jeans shoes know minutes may sound like lot but it wasn lake said he found out about the fire from his son scott who was coming home from fort worth early tuesday morning at first scott thought the fire was at fair park but as he got closer he realized the ambassador was ablaze at he texted his father with photo of flames shooting out the windows on the ervay side jim lake showed me that photo his hands shook as he held the phone it was scott who first got jim interested in the ambassador it was scott who brokered the deal even in the fog of grief jim lake couldn help himself he pointed toward the building and the red clay brick peeking out from behind the white exterior see that arch that must have been the original entrance before they covered it up in the the fire revealed history even while consuming it little later in the morning jim lake walked over to the mountain of bricks spilled along ervay for moment he started at the building what you could see of it anyway behind the shroud of smoke and water he then leaned over and grabbed brick which he passed around to colleagues standing watch by fire command lake was awed by its weight heavier than any brick ve ever held he said solid he said he would try to salvage as much of the ruins as possible and use them to construct whatever comes next it will still be the ambassador lake said knowing full well it won be only pieces of it throughout the morning onlookers began filing out to stare at the charred remains tv news crews remained at distance firefighters took photos once they were told of the hotel age its significance the special place it holds for so many who will never see this part of downtown the same away again initially dallas fire rescue planned to go ahead and take down what remains of the building because they have deemed it unsafe but the city has no equipment capable of razing the ambassador so lake spent the morning with contractors discussing bids planning the funeral instead of the resurrection just wish there was way we could save it lake said over and over just wish there was way to save it but there is not and now another piece of dallas history is gone erased by fire disaster damned tragedy the dallas morning news visit the dallas
